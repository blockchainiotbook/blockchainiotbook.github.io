      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy plays a fundamental role in building citizen confidence in
        emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence
        (AI). Personal data breaches, privacy and cyber security issues are a
        major source of mistrust in AI. On the one hand, governments around the
        world want to initiate a strategy to introduce AI in public
        organizations. On the other hand, blockchain technology is presented as
        a "trust machine" to secure AI, given its new approach to data security.
        Thus, this book will explore various areas in which blockchain and AI
        has an impact on privacy.
      </p>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        This book wishes to identify and pose the problems related to privacy in
        the areas of digital identity and connected objects. In fact, the
        increased use of IoT in our daily life and their impact on health,
        finance, and critical infrastructures requires the preservation of our
        privacy. Several researchers pointed out the blockchain as a potential
        solution to help address some of the IoT security and scalability
        challenges. Concretely, the book will address digital identity as a
        technological and legal vehicle for the protection of personal data.
        Moreover, the book will consider personal data that is collected via
        connected objects. The book will analyze security issues, taking into
        account the preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability
        of data and information systems. Finally, the book will explore the
        application perspectives of blockchain in AI with the objective of
        bringing new perspectives on the opacity of AI, which is not able to
        justify, explain or interpret its decisions.
      </p>
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The book will help AI professionals, and IoT and personnel data managers
        to demystify the use of Explainable AI and Blockchain technology to
        resolve privacy issues. Governments and other organizations may use the
        outcomes of this book as a reference to make choices regarding IoT and
        privacy related strategies.
